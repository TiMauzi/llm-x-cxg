## ðŸ‘€ `detection` &ndash; results for construction detection

* `result_{a}t_vs_{b}f_{c}_{d}attempts_{e}_{f}.tsv` â†’ Results for the experiments on detecting correct samples for constructions.
  * `a` - number of true/correct samples
  * `b` - number of false/incorrect samples
  * `c` - usage of kelex pseudowords
  * `d` - number of attempts per comparison
  * `e` - used model
  * `f` - if "2": task is made easier, because the number of correct samples given and the model just has to find the correct ones
